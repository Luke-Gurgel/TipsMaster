# TipsMaster

Splitting the tips among everyone should be easier. This app uses CoreData to store 3 pieces of information about each employee: name, tips and hours. All you have to do is input the info and let the app do the math.

Wait, there's more! It uses the merge sort algorithm to sort the tips in a descending order so people who got a lot don't get paid in $1 bills.
